## Meet the Community: Michelle Hertzfeld, Open Source Product Manager @ IPFS Cluster / Protocol Labs

### Tell us a bit about yourself and your background. How did you get involved with IPFS and end up joining the team at Protocol Labs?

My background is in international environmental policy, specifically around drylands management (I studied arid lands in the American Southwest and China). It’s not as unrelated as you think! I started my career working in remote sensing and GIS research and outreach at (the [Arizona Remote Sensing Center at the University of Arizona](https://snre.arizona.edu/facilities/arsc). As part of the university [Cooperative Extension](https://extension.arizona.edu/about) program, we held workshops for farmers, ranchers, and agency personnel to learn how to apply GPS technology and satellite imagery to land management. Fast forward several years, and you’d find me at the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://www.noaa.gov/) (NOAA) working on international Earth observation data access and exchange, and then at the [Department of the Interior](https://www.doi.gov/) as a [Presidential Innovation Fellow](https://presidentialinnovationfellows.gov/) working on federal government open data efforts. In all of these roles, my job was to make science information more discoverable, findable, understandable, and usable. IPFS has the potential to finally solve some really tough problems around how we manage data together to understand the world around us. I joined Protocol Labs when an Open Source Product Manager role opened that was specifically focused on Decentralized Data Stewardship -- a perfect fit!

### Why should people be excited about IPFS?

IPFS is like a second chance -- a second chance to get the internet *right* for humans. There are certain things about the way our worldwide network is structured right now that make it really hard to “do right” by its users. Right now, it’s tough to manage your own data, make your own choices about what you see or don’t see, or keep your information secure online. I see IPFS as our chance to learn from how people ended up using HTTP networks, and make our next network more usable, [responsible](https://ethicalos.org/), and secure. We can do this by making the better choices also the easiest paths for people to follow; I want to automate our best selves into our next world-wide network.

### What projects are really exciting you in the IPFS Ecosystem at the moment and why?

Well, I’m a bit biased because I spend a good bit of my day-to-day on this team, but the [IPFS Cluster](https://cluster.ipfs.io/) project is really exciting! Cluster is building a control layer on top of IPFS to support data availability and data/system administration on the distributed web. IPFS is exciting as a protocol, but to make a peer-to-peer, content-addressed approach viable for large-scale data management, the ecosystem needs a few more features, such as automatic replication across peers (to make sure data is always available), and certain access controls. And these additional features need to be delivered in a user-centric, user-friendly way. This is the space that Cluster works in. And it works today! Of course we’ve got a roadmap towards additional features, but go check it out! You can have your own IPFS Cluster swarm *right now* that automatically replicates your data at whatever rate you choose.

### Open Source communities are full of unsung heroes. Is there someone in IPFS community who you admire for their work?

Brendan O’Brien at [Qri.io](https://qri.io/) (pronounced “query”). He not only has deep understanding of peer-to-peer, distributed architectures plus deep experience in data management, he also has a knack for explaining really complex ideas in ways that are fun and accessible. I mean look at that website -- what friendly data blobs heading to the data party!

### What are you most looking forward to at IPFS Camp?

Meeting new people who are thinking about IPFS in ways I’ve never considered. I think we’ll all be inspired by the different angles people come at this technology from.
